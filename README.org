* Some benefits of Svelte
- requires less code
- smaller bundle sizes
- simpler state management within and across components
- it's a compiler and not a framework, not a framework, let me say it agin....NOT a framework
- there is no virtual DOM
  - svelte provides reactivity by tracking changes to parts of DOM and re-renders only affect areas
